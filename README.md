  ## Installation    

  To install the **Exercise-Tracker** please follow these steps:

  1. Download all of the project's source files `(clone the GitHub repository)`.
  2. Ensure your terminal is inside of the current folder that contains the source files.
  3. Install the following **NPMs** `(Node Package Managers)` in the system terminal:
        * Node.js
        * Enter ```npm i``` that will install all of the packages within the `package.json` file necessary to run the application. 

    Once all of that has been completed, run ```node server.js``` to initiate the program.

  ## Usage    

  Once the application is running the the user can press the button `add workout` to then be redirected to the exercise page. Then the user will choose from a dropdown list whether they are entering a `resistance` or `cardio` based exercise. Then they enter the name, weight, and other relevant information pertaining to the kind of workout being completed. Once done, the user can press add exercise. That will then be populated in the stats page which shows a few graphs of the workouts that were completed. The workouts will be stored into the database and shown on a graph. Then when they go back to the homepage it will show the amount of the exercises the user completed in that day. If the user wants to add more they can repeat the steps annd watch their progress add up.
